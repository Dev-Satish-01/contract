Simple Lending Platform (Ethereum) - DeFi Project
Create a basic decentralized lending platform on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. The platform should allow users to deposit, withdraw, borrow, and repay funds.

Requirements: The basic functionality that it should contain:-

Deposit: Users should be able to deposit Ethereum into the lending platform.
Withdraw: Users should be able to withdraw Ethereum from the platform.
Borrow: Users should be able to borrow Ethereum from the platform.
Repay: Users should be able to repay borrowed Ethereum.
Check Balance: Implement a function for users to check their current balance.

Do make sure that the contract and functions implemented should have some basic rules included(Hint: A user cannot deposit a negative amount etc.) and save the transactions on Blockchain using event function.

Optional Enhancements:
Implement interest rates.
Use ERC-20 tokens for handling funds.
And any other features you can think of, these are just suggestions.
